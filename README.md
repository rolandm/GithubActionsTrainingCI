# GitHub Octodex RSS Feed Renderer

This repository hosts a basic [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that can consume the 
[GitHub Octodex](https://octodex.github.com/) RSS feed and then render the extracted feed 
items into a web page so the Octocats can be viewed in all their glory.



## Building
This is a standard Next.js application that uses the `next` framework to develop and build the application.

To run the application locally, use `npm run dev` from the checked out source code (after installing the dependencies of course using `npm install`). The application will start up and bind to port `3000` making the server available from http://localhost:3000
